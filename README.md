# Accessing Data Files on Cloud Object Storage 

Modern data landscapes rely heavily on scalable, durable, and cost-effective cloud object storage solutions such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3, Microsoft Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS), and Google Cloud Storage (GCS). Connecting these platforms seamlessly with the power of SAS® analytics is crucial for organizations seeking to leverage their data assets at scale.    This session will explore the robust connectivity options within SAS® Viya® that enable data professionals to read, write, and manage data files stored in these diverse cloud environments. Students will experience proof of value by directly reading and processing object storage files with SAS® Viya® .
